Attached is the zip file containing my PCB design for converting AC to DC. It has been designed fully on KiCad 8.0. 
This is my first PCB design. I have designed it to fit a 150 X 100 mm copper clad for etching. 

Also, 3 PNG files of the layout have been attached too, for a good three dimensional view of my design.

The purpose of this design is to convert 12 V AC to 5V DC as well as 12V DC. 
Kindly Note: The stepdown transformer to convert 230V AC to 12 V AC hasn't been included here in this design but there is sufficient space available on the board to accommodate for it's installation.
